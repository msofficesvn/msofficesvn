Add-in files under 2007 folder has Office2007 ribbon interface, and they work on Office2007 but does not work on older Office.

Add-in files under 97-2003 folder has legacy menu and toolbar interface, and they work on Office97 to Office2007. 
Of course I recommend you to install ribbon interface add-in files under 2007 folder for Office2007.
